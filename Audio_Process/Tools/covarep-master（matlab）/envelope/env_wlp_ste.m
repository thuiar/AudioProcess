% STE_WLP Short-time-energy-weighted linear prediction
%   [A,w] = ste_wlp(s,p,m,k)
%
% Description
%   This function fits linear prediction coefficients to the analysis
%   frame using the basic form of weighted linear prediction (WLP), i.e., 
%   by weighting each value of the squared prediction error by the short-time 
%   energy (STE) of the previous samples.
%
% Inputs
%   s      : Speech signal frame [samples]
%   p      : Order of WLP analysis
%   m      : Length of the STE window (default to p)
%   k      : Delay of the STE window (default to 1)
%
% Outputs
%   A      : Linear prediction inverse filter coefficients
%   w      : the STE weighting function
%
% Notes
%   Even though coefficients are solved using a criterion similar to the
%   autocorrelation method of linear prediction, because of the weighting
%   the filter is not guaranteed to be stable. If a stable synthesis filter
%   is required, use STE_SWLP instead.
%
% Example
%   A = ste_wlp(s,p) gives the linear predictive inverse filter
%   coefficients optimized using STE-WLP
