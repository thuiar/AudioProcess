% FO: detection of Fundamental frequency and Open quotient on the basis of the
% derivative of the electroglottographic signal.
% This is the script that calls the various functions for analysis of the
% electroglottographic signal.
% 
% The sequence of operations is as follows:
% - the function CRO detects the points where the DEGG signal crosses the threshold
% set for peak detection, and calls the function RIM which determines where peaks
% begin and end
%
% - the function AMPOS reinterpolates the signal within the peak regions (to
% obtain a more accurate measurement of peak height) and calls the function
% PEAKSHAPE to detect the number of summits and the ratio of the amplitude of
% the summits
%
% - the function DETECTMULT treats double peaks of another kind: double peaks
% that are almost completely distinct, and belong in different "peak bunches"
% (regions created by CRO), but which are too close for their Fo to make sense,
% and are thus considered as making up one double/multiple peak. 
% There are thus two vectors containing information on double peaks: verif, for
% peaks which are unique at threshold level and fork at a higher level; and
% doublepeaks for peaks which fork below threshold level.
%
% - the function SIMP calculates an approximative Fo value.

% retrieving user choice for smoothing step. Reminder: 0 means no smoothing; 1
% means smoothing 1 point to the left and right, i.e. over 3 data points; 2
% means smoothing 2 points to the left and right, i.e. over 5 data points, etc.
