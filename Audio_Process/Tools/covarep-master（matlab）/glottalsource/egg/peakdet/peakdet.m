% Analysis of the electroglottographic signal for a continuously voiced
%  item of normal speech: typically, one syllable or a portion of a syllable.
%
% Description
%  This function was devised for *spoken* materials, as opposed to *sung* materials:
%  it was found that Nathalie Henrich's <decom.m> MatLab function, devised for
%  the singing voice, did not yield results for speech data
%  (specifically: Vietnamese syllables with strong glottalization) because
%  the EGG signal failed to meet the criterion for quasi-periodicity. Hence the
%  decision to develop a new function, which, like <decom.m>, detects closing
%  peaks and opening peaks on the derivative of the EGG signal, but by a
%  *threshold* method and not by autocorrelation [1,2].
%
%  Created in October 2004, with minor changes in July 2005 and July 2007.
%
% Inputs
%  SIG: The input EGG signal, in VFCA convention (vocal-fold contact area), 
%       i.e. EGG increases with glottal contact. The peak at closure is thus
%            positive in the EGG derivative.
%  FS : [Hz] The sampling frequency of the EGG signal.
%  F0 : The maximum possible F0 (e.g. F0=500Hz).
%  smoothingstep: the step for EGG smoothing. From zero (no smoothing) to 3 (or more) points to the left and right.
% Smoothing the DEGG signal turned out to be useful
% in the many cases where there is one single opening peak but its amplitude is
% very small and it tends to be drowned in noise. A smoothing step of 1 means
% smoothing 1 point to the left and right; 2 means averaging over (2x2+1) = 5 points.
% As the programme computes the open quotient results by four methods two of
% which operate on the unsmoothed signal, it is avisable to choose a smoothing
% step that is higher than zero even if the user believes that this smoothing is unnecessary:
% this assumption can be verified by comparing the results with and without
% smoothing, which will show a complete fit if the original signal has very
% little background noise.
% Concerning the choice of a smoothing step for noisy signals : a step up to 5
% can be chosen ; visual comparison of the DEGG signals before and after
% smoothing is recommended to verify that this smoothing does not make
% neighbouring peaks coalesce. It must be remembered that in some cases the DEGG
% method simply does not apply, and (arguably) should not be forcibly applied:
% if taken to its limits, smoothing artificially creates a neat hump for opening
% and one for closing, but these humps fudge up the issue, as they do not
% correspond to any precise physiological reality anymore : the advantage of the
% DEGG method is that it is based on an established relationship between the
% DEGG signal and significant glottal events ; extreme smoothing blurs this
% relationship.
% In a nutshell : a smoothing step of 1 is adequate for high-quality signals
% (which already appear visually as very smooth), a smoothing step of 2 or 3
% increases correct peak detection in relatively noisy signals. Fudging-up of
% opening peaks was only observed with a smoothing step of 6 or more. 
%  Method: Method chosen to handle double closing peaks in F0 calculation:
%                 if <method == 0>: selecting highest of the peaks
%                 if <method == 1>: selecting first peak
%                 if <method == 2>: selecting last peak
%                 if <method == 3>: using barycentre method
%                 if <method == 4>: exclude all double peaks
%       
%          The duration of glottal cycles is measured by detecting positive
%          peaks on the derivative of the electroglottographic signal (hereafter
%          DEGG). The inverse of this duration is still called
%          "fundamental frequency", but there is no check on periodicity, as
%          peaks are detected individually. This is different from correlation-
%          based methods (such as DECOM: Henrich et al. 2004). Thus this
%          algorithm provides indications on glottal cycles even for
%          laryngealized ("creaky") portions of signal.

% Setting the resampling coefficient. The electroglottographic signal is
%  resampled (reinterpolated) at the closing and opening peaks for accurate
%  peak detection; the coefficient for reinterpolation is set at 100 by default;

% Choosing maximum possible F0. To avoid absurd results in the case of double
% closing peaks, a threshold on maximum fundamental frequency is set by the
% user, and peaks that are so close that the corresponding F0 is above this
% threshold are considered as belonging in the same "peak cluster".
maxF = F0;
% In light of the great differences in F0 range across speakers and across the
% experimental tasks that they perform, it did not appear adequate to set the
% same threshold for all speakers (say, 500 Hz): the user must be allowed to
% modify the threshold.
% It was not found useful to set a lower threshold parallel to this upper
% threshold. Implausibly low values in the results point to one of the following
% situations :
%  - One closing peak has been detected before the onset of voicing or after the
%    offset of voicing, resulting in the detection of a ‘period’ the inverse of
%    which is under 20 Hz. These cases can be corrected by suppressing the first
%    or last period ; this option is offered by the program, at the stage where
%    the user is asked to check the results.
%  - Some closing peaks within a voiced portion of signal have gone undetected
%    because their amplitude is below the threshold. The user must then check on
%    the figure which amplitude threshold is to be chosen for all the peaks to
%    be detected, and set the amplitude threshold accordingly ; this option is
%    offered by the program when the user is asked to confirm the results.
